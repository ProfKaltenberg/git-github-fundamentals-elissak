# Hello 

I learned how to create a readme page
---
## I am still trying to fully understand what documentation looks like and how to properly do that 
## Creating the profile and readme profile page was fun
# I really enjoy putting emojis and GIFS into the code 
# I learned how to use terminal, GitHub and how to do pull requests
ðŸŒ  Thank you
